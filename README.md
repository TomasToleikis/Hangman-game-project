# Hangman game project
A final project by Tomas Toleikis for Vislnius School Of AI class D
This is a classic Hangman game, made in Google Colab.

The game takes a random word from the hangman_words.txt and invites a player to guess it by displaying underlines indicating the nr of letters in the word.
When the letter guessed is correct, the letter is displayed in the line of underlines.
When the quess is wrong, the symbol art of gallows is displayed - creating a hangman with each miss (6 misses untill game over).

# Requirements
The file must be opened in Google Colab.
The list of words is inluded as a hangman_words.txt. There is a separate cell at the begining that imports the file for game to use.

THE FILE IMPORTING CELL MUST BE RAN BEFORE PLAYING THE GAME.
